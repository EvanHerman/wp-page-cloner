#### FAQ

**How come I can't change my permalinks?**

You need to make sure that your permalinks are set to anything but the default inside of `Settings > Permalinks`. Once the permalinks are changed from the defaults you should have no problem changing the permlink of your page.

**I have (a) custom post type(s) registered on my site. Can I use this plugin to clone it?**

Yes! We've built out a settings page ('Settings > WP Page Cloner') where you can specify which post types are cloneable. By default only pages and posts are active. You can add or remove any registered post type on your site.
